/**
 * [Docs link](https://blacksmithftc.vercel.app/util/kt/lateinitval)
 *
 * A delegate class used to simulate a lateinit value; any variable that delegates to this may
 * only be initialized once, but it may be initialized whenever it is desired.
 *
 * __NOTE:__ _This only works for class members,_ and is __Kotlin only__.
 *
 * Also, __this is not thread safe.__ Thread safety will be implemented if required.
 *
 * Usage example:
 * ```
 * class IntegerThatCanOnlyBeSetOnce {
 *   var int: Int by LateInitVal()
 *   // or
 *   var int by LateInitVal<Int>()
 * }
 *
 * //...
 *
 * fun test1() {
 *   val myInt = IntegerThatCanOnlyBeSetOnce()
 *   myInt.int = 1 // this is fine
 *   myInt.int = 2 // throws an exception; int has already been initialized
 * }
 *
 * fun test2() {
 *   val myInt = IntegerThatCanOnlyBeSetOnce()
 *   println(myInt.int) // throws an exception; int is uninitialized
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * _Motivation:_ When reading through Rogue's opmodes from last year, a major issue was that
 * I simply could not tell which variables were genuinely intended to be modified and which
 * ones were effectively final. This helps makes intentions more clear from the get-go.
 *
 * @param T The type of the value that is being delegated to.
