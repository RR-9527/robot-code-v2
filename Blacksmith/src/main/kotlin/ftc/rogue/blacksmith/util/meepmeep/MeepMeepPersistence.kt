/**
 * [Docs link](https://blacksmithftc.vercel.app/util/meepmeep/persistence)
 *
 * A class to persist the state of the visualizer window.
 *
 * Basically saves the position of the [MeepMeep] GUI window so that it opens in the some position
 * that it was closed in.
 *
 *
 *  Basic usage example:
 * ```java
 * MeepMeep meepMeep = new MeepMeep(windowSize);
 *
 * // Create a persistence object linked to the MeepMeep instance
 * MeepMeepPersistence persistence = new MeepMeepPersistence(meepMeep);
 *
 * // Restore the settings from the persistence object to the MeepMeep instance
 * persistence.restore();
 * ```
 *
 * **NOTE:** The settings autosave every 2 seconds, and when MeepMeep is closed from the 'X'.
