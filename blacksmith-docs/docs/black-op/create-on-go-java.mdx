# CreateOnGo (Java)

:::caution Important
This only works if you extend the `BlackOp` class. More info about that [here](./overview). It's essentially LinearOpMode with
a few extra utilities, and it's made for use with the Blacksmith Library.

**If you're using Kotlin, check out [createOnGo/evalOnGo](./create-on-go-kt) for a more versatile and idiomatic method**
:::

:::warning
This is partially in beta, so if you find your code crashing when you add this and it works if you
remove it, don't be surprised. It should work though, from my testing.
:::

:::tip
If you need to instantiate a class that needs parameters, or just want to use the return value of
a method, check out [@EvalOnGo](./eval-on-go-java) instead!
:::

You know how in a typical OpMode you have to be all like this or something?

```java
private MyArmClass myArm;

@Override
public void init() throws InterruptedException {
    myArm = new MyArmClass(...) // ugly duplication of class names & extra boilerplate smh my head
}
```

With `@CreateOnGo`, you can simply do this instead:

```java
@CreateOnGo
private MyArmClass myArm; // (Sadly doesn't work with final variables D:)
```

Yep, that's it. Of course, there is one small teeny weeny itsy-bitsy caveat though:

**The specific class type MUST have either <ins>a no-args constructor</ins>, or <ins>a constructor that takes in only a HardwareMap</ins>, or it _will_ error.**

If you want to use a constructor that takes in a HardwareMap only (e.g. SampleMecanumDrive), you must do `@CreateOnGo(passHwMap = true)` instead.

:::tip
On the bright side, BlackOp contains a global `hwMap` and a global `mTelemetry` you can use!
:::

```java
public class MyOp extends BlackOp {
    @CreateOnGo
    private MyClaw myClaw;

    @CreateOnGo(passHwMap = true)
    private SampleMecanumDrive drive;

    // this-will-error
    @CreateOnGo
    // this-will-error
    private MyWife maiWaife;
}

class MyClaw {
    // Has no-args constructor, so it's valid
    public MyClaw() {
        this(BlackOp.hwMap())
    }

    // It's fine if there's additional multi-arg constructors
    public MyClaw(HardwareMap hwMap) {
        ...
    }
}

class SampleMecanumDrive {
    // ...

    // This is fine, just be sure to pass in 'passHwMap = true' to @CreateOnGo
    public SampleMecanumDrive(HardwareMap hardwareMap) {
        ...
    }

    // ...
}

class MyWife {
    // No no-args constructor, will throw exception when tries to @CreateOnGo
    // (Also you shouldn't be objectifying women smh)
    public MyWife(Tenges cost) {
        ...
    }
}
```
