# EvalOnGo (Java)

:::caution Important
This only works if you extend the `BlackOp` class. More info about that [here](./overview). It's essentially LinearOpMode with
a few extra utilities, and it's made for use with the Blacksmith Library.

**If you're using Kotlin, check out [createOnGo/evalOnGo](./create-on-go-kt) for a more versatile and idiomatic method**
:::

:::warning
This is partially in beta, so if you find your code crashing when you add this and it works if you
remove it, don't be surprised. It should work though, from my testing.
:::

:::tip
If you're instantiating a class that doesn't need any args, or only takes a `hardwareMap`, check out
[@CreateOnGo](./create-on-go-java) instead!
:::

You know how in a typical OpMode you sometimes have to be all like this or something?

```java
private MyArmClass myArm;

@Override
public void init() throws InterruptedException {
    myArm = myMethodToCreateAnArm();
}

public MyArmClass myMethodToCreateAnArm() {
    return MyArmClass(name, param1, param1, ...);
}
```

With `@EvalOnGo`, you can simply do this instead:

```java
@EvalOnGo("myMethodToCreateAnArm")
private MyArmClass myArm; // (Sadly doesn't work with final variables D:)
```

Yep, that's it. Of course, there is one small teeny weeny itsy-bitsy caveat though:

The specific method type MUST have a <ins>no-args version</ins>, or it _will_ error.

Also, make sure you type in the method name exactly and that it returns the correct type (it can return
a subclass), or it will error as well.

```java
public class MyOp extends BlackOp {
    @EvalOnGo(method="makeMyClaw")
    private MyClaw myClaw;

    // this-will-error
    @EvalOnGo(method="makeMyArm1")
    private MyArm myArm1;

    // this-will-error
    @EvalOnGo(method="makeMyArm2")
    private MyArm myArm2;

    private MyClaw makeMyClaw() {
        return ...;
    }

    // It's fine if there's an args version as long as there's a
    // no-args overload, such as the above
    MyClaw makeMyClaw(int param1) {
        return ...;
    }

    // this-will-error
    // Will throw an error since there's no no-args version
    // this-will-error
    public MyArm myArm1(String name) {
    // this-will-error
        return ...;
    // this-will-error
    }

    // this-will-error
    // Will throw an error since it returns the wrong type
    // this-will-error
    protected MaiWaife myArm2() {
    // this-will-error
        return ...;
    // this-will-error
    }
}
```

## Calling a static method from another class

:::warning
Make sure the method you're calling from another class is static and has no args
:::

Just add another parameter called `clazz` and assign it to whatever class contains the static method.

```java
@EvalOnGo(method="makeArm", clazz=MyArmClass.class)
private MyArmClass myArm;

// ...

class MyArmClass {
    public static MyArmClass makeArm() {
        // ...
    }
}
```
