# CreateOnGo (Kt)

:::caution Important
This only works if you extend the `BlackOp` class. More info about that [here](./overview). It's essentially LinearOpMode with
a few extra utilities, and it's made for use with the Blacksmith Library.
:::

The BlackOp class two different methods to keep your component creation simple and idiomatic:
 - `createOnGo`
 - `evalOnGo`

You know how in a typical OpMode you have to be all like this or something?

```kotlin
private lateinit var myArm: MyArmClass // Unidiomatic unneccesarily mutable state

override fun init() {
    myArm = MyArmClass(...) // Ugly and also duplication of the name/class.
}
```

With `createOnGo`, you can simply do this instead:

```kotlin
// Immutable state, no duplication
private val myArm by createOnGo<MyArmClass>()

// Keep in mind you need to use lambdas though
private val myClaw by createOnGo<MyClawClass> { param1 }

// for each parameter
private val myLift by createOnGo<MyLiftClass>({ param1 }, { param2 })
```

If you need to call a method or have a lot of parameters or do something more advanced, you can use `evalOnGo` instead,
to call a function which returns the object you want to create at go-time.

```kotlin
// No need to explicitly say '<DcMotorEx>' here since Kotlin can infer it from the function return type
private val myThing by evalOnGo {
    createSomethingThroughAFunction(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, hwMap, anotherFunction(hwMap))
}
```

:::warning
`createOnGo` uses reflection, so it can occasionally be a bit finicky. If you're having issues, try `evalOnGo`.

Make sure that **the argument's types are the same as the desired constructor**, and that **the order is the same**,
as the method parameters are <ins>**NOT type safe**</ins>
:::

## `createOnGo`

<ParamsList params={[
  {
    type: 'reified T',
    desc: 'The type you want to construct',
    isGeneric: true,
  },
  {
    name: 'args',
    type: 'vararg () -> Any',
    desc: 'Any number of lambda functions that return the parameters you want to pass to the constructor of the class you want to create. Not evaluated until the OpMode is started'
  }
]}/>

<Returns returns={{
  type: 'T',
  desc: 'The class constructed by invoking the constructor of said class with the corresponding parameters',
}}/>


## `evalOnGo`

<ParamsList params={[
  {
    type: 'T',
    desc: 'The type you want to construct',
    isGeneric: true,
  },
  {
    name: 'constructor',
    type: '() -> T',
    desc: 'A lambda function that returns the object you want to create. Not evaluated until the OpMode is started'
  }
]}/>

<Returns returns={{
  type: 'T',
  desc: 'The object returned by the given lambda',
}}/>

## Practical example

We use it extensively in our base opmodes, especially our base TeleOp
