# On

:::danger
I feel like I don't have to say this by now, but anyways, this won't work unless the
Scheduler is running.
:::

:::tip
I also recommend using the Listener and other things when you don't need something complicated
as they're more lightweight and less bug-prone
:::

On. A powerful WIP component that will allow you to make your complex scheduling nightmares come
true with a simple, declarative builder syntax. You can think of it as a much more powerful, if
not slightly more computationally expensive [Listener](./listeners)

Say that every other time a certain button is pressed (on the rising edge0), except for the first
time, you want to execute `x` action for ~500 milliseconds, but stop doing this the first time your
lift gets to max height.

This is obviously a contrived example, but still, normally, the code for this would be pretty messy,
but here it is using On:

<Tabs groupId="programming-language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

  ```java
  new On(() -> gamepad1.a)
       .becomingTrue()
       .withOffset(3)
       .extendFor(500)
       .milliseconds()
       .until(() -> lift.getHeight() < Lift.MAX_HEIGHT)
       .execute(() -> whateverAction());
  ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kt" label="Kotlin">

  ```kotlin
  On { gamepad1.a }
      .becomingTrue()
      .withOffset(3)
      .extendFor(500)
      .milliseconds()
      .until { lift.height < Lift.MAX_HEIGHT }
      .execute { whateverAction() }
  ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
This is a WIP component and more features to allow for even more convoluted queries becoming simple
will come soon.

## On hierarchy (so far)
```
--------------------------------
| Hierarchy (I understand this doesn't make much sense yet so let me explain a little):
| - every():
| --- single() |
| --- other()  |
| --- third()  |
| --- nth(n)   :
| ----- timeBeingTrue()     |
| ----- timeBeingFalse()    |
| ----- timeBecomingTrue()  |
| ----- timeBecomingFalse() :
| ------ withOffset() ^
| ------- doUntil(λn.b)
| ------- doFor(n):
| --------- iterations()
| --------- milliseconds()
| --------- time(u)
| ------- doWhile(λn.b)
| - beingTrue():
| --> every().single().timeBeingTrue()
| - beingFalse():
| --> every().single().timeBeingFalse()
| - becomingTrue():
| --> every().single().timeBecomingTrue()
| - becomingFalse():
| --> every().single().timeBecomingFalse()
|
| Terminal operations:
| - until()
| - forever()
|
| Finally:
| - execute(λ)
--------------------------------
```

## Explanation

:::note
I won't dive toooo deep into this since I feel like it's not too hard to explore on your own with
just IDE autocomplete and such, but I'll give a decent explanation
:::

:::caution
The order in which these functions can be called matters.
:::

On(() -> condition) is the entry point to this twisted tree of function chaining, where you pass
in the initial condition to be acted upon.

From there, you can let the hierarchy and autocomplete guide you to your intended destination,
but I can just explain the methods rq

### every()

The entry point to the branch of On which deals with continuous listening (i.e. it doesn't stop
after the first 'x' conditions).

From here, you can call `every().single()`, `every().other()`, `every().third()`, or
`every().nth(n)` to move on, specifying what on interval you should be responding to actions.

`every().single()` means you respond to every time the final condition comes true

`every().other()` means you respond to every other (every second) the final condition comes true

and so on

### - timeBeingX

Specifies that the action be acted upon "every time" the condition is true/false. When I say "every
time", I mean every time specified by the aforementioned interval.

From here you can call `withOffset()`, `until()/forever()`, or any of the extension methods.

### - timeBecomingX

Specifies that the action be acted upon "every time" the condition *becomes* true/false (i.e. on the
rising or falling edge). When I say "every time", I mean every time specified by the aforementioned
interval.

From here you can call `withOffset()`, `until()/forever()`, or any of the extension methods.

### -- withOffset()

Specifies how many initial true conditions to skip.

For example, say you want to listen to a button every time it's pressed, except for the first
three times. Using a .withOffset(3) would skip the first three times the button is pressed.

### --- extendFor

Along with `doUntil()`, this is a way to easily extend the effect of your condition becoming true. I'll
just give you a couple really simple example to work with because I think it'll explain it better
than I can with just words

```java
// Whenever the button is pressed, prints "hihihihihi"
// If someone pressed 'a' once, then pressed it again in 2 loops,
// it would just restart the 4 extra loop counter.
On(() -> gamepad1.a)
    .every()
    .single()
    .timeBecomingTrue() // Act every time gamepad1.a is *just* pressed (rising edge)
    .extendFor(4)
    .iterations() // "Extend" the calling of the end function by two scheduler loops
    .forever() // Never stop
    .execute(() -> System.out.print("hi!"));

// Whenever the button is pressed, prints "hi" for the next second
// If someone pressed 'a' once, then pressed it again half a second later,
// it would restart the 1 second timer
On(() -> gamepad1.a)
    .every()
    .single()
    .timeBecomingTrue() // Act every time gamepad1.a is *just* pressed (rising edge)
    .extendFor(1)
    .time(TimeUnit.SECONDS) // "Extend" the calling of the end function for 1 second
    .forever() // Never stop
    .execute(() -> System.out.print("hi!"));
```

from here you can call a terminal operation (forever()/until())

### --- doUntil

**Note that this is different from until()**

Like `extendFor()`, but you pass in your *own* extension function, and it keeps extending
until you return 'true'.

The extension function takes in two arguments:
 - a boolean specifying whether or not the condition is true or not
 - a long specifying how many times the 'On' has been looped

```java
// Whenever the button is pressed, starts printing hi and never stops since 'until' always
// returns 'false'
On(() -> gamepad1.a)
    .every()
    .single()
    .timeBecomingTrue() // Act every time gamepad1.a is *just* pressed (rising edge)
    .doUntil((condIsTrue, count) -> false)
    .forever() // Never stop
    .execute(() -> System.out.print("hi!"));
```

from here you can call a terminal operation (forever()/until())

### (Terminal) forever()

A terminal operation which creates the actual Schedulable object which you can subscribe things
to.

`forever()` means keep going and never stop until the Scheduler is [nuked](./scheduler#schedulernuke)

```java
// Whenever the button is pressed, starts printing hi and never stops since 'until' always
// returns 'false'
On(() -> gamepad1.a)
    .every()
    .single()
    .timeBecomingTrue() // Act every time gamepad1.a is *just* pressed (rising edge)
    .doUntil((condIsTrue, count) -> false)
    .forever() // Never stop
    .execute(() -> System.out.print("hi!"));
```

### (Terminal) until()

**Note that this is different from doUntil()**

A terminal operation which creates the actual Schedulable object which you can subscribe things
to.

`until()` takes in a function (lambda) which in turn takes in a long which specifies how many times
the On has been looped. If the passed in function returns 'true', the On instance is destroyed.
(Hard reset is prob a better word for it, it'd still be usable if you resubscribe actions to it)

```java
// Whenever the button is pressed, starts printing hi and stops when the On instance has been looped
// over 1000 times
// But it doesn't just stop, it unhooks the whole On instance and clears all of it's actions
// aka it "destroys" it, or rather hard resets it
On(() -> gamepad1.a)
    .every()
    .single()
    .timeBecomingTrue() // Act every time gamepad1.a is *just* pressed (rising edge)
    .doUntil((condIsTrue, count) -> false)
    .until((count) -> count > 1000) // Never stop
    .execute(() -> System.out.print("hi!"));
```

### execute()

Called on the built On instance, `execute()` takes in a function to run whenever the final
condition, with all of the offsets and stuff taken into account is true. Can be called multiple
times to subscribe multiple actions to the same listener.

```java
// Prints "hi!\n" while gamepad1.a is pressed
On(() -> gamepad1.a)
    .every()
    .single()
    .timeBeingTrue()
    .forever()
    .execute(() -> System.out.print("h"))
    .execute(() -> System.out.print("i"))
    .execute(() -> System.out.print("!"))
    .execute(() -> System.out.println());
```

## oh and one more thing

Every time you call another builder method, it creates an entirely new immutable object, so that
means you can reuse partially build Ons with no worry

```java
// This is fine
OnEveryNth onEverySingleGamepad1a = On(() -> gamepad1.a)
    .every()
    .single();

onEverySingleGamepad1a
    .whatever();

onEverySingleGamepad1a
    .whateverElse();
```
