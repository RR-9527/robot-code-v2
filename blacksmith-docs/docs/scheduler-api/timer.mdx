# Timers

:::warning
A timer's resolution is tied to the performance of the Scheduler loop. If there's a heavy computation involved,
the timer may not fire at the exact time it was scheduled for.

For example, if you have a timer set to go off in 50ms, but the loop is busy for an extra 50ms, the timer will fire up to
100ms after it was scheduled.

This is not meant for very precise timing. But then again, without multithreading (which I don't reallly recommend for
most cases), it's not really possible to get a higher resolution timer anyways. **It's good enough for most use cases.**

also doesn't work unless Scheduler is running.

## Overview

Timers are simply an abstraction over the Listener API. They are a convenient way to schedule a function to be called
after a certain amount of time, or to do a function until it reaches said time.

:::tip
For disposable timer use cases, look at the [`Timer.after()`](#after) method for Java, or the [`after`](#after)
class for Kotlin.

These are very useful and cleaner than the raw Timer API in many cases!

## Timer methods

### Construction

Constructs a new Timer with the given delay. Timer is automatically started upon creation, but you can set it to pending
by passing `true` as the second argument, or using `startPending = true` in Kotlin.

<ParamsList params={[
  {
    name: 'length',
    type: 'long',
    desc: 'The length of the timer. See the \'unit\' parameter to set the time unit',
  },
  {
    name: 'startPending',
    type: 'boolean',
    desc: 'Whether the timer should start in a pending state. If true, the timer will not start until you call `start()`',
    defaultsTo: 'false',
  },
  {
    name: 'unit',
    type: 'TimeUnit',
    desc: 'The time unit of the timer. Defaults to milliseconds',
    typeLink: TypeLinks.TIME_UNIT,
    defaultsTo: 'TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS',
  }
]}/>

<Tabs groupId="programming-language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

  ```java
  Timer timer1 = new Timer(1000); // Ends after ~1000ms

  Timer timer2 = new Timer(1000, true); // Stays pending until you call start()

  Timer timer3 = new Timer(1, false, TimeUnit.SECONDS); // Ends after ~1 second
  ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kt" label="Kotlin">

  ```kotlin
  val timer1 = Timer(1000) // Ends after ~1000ms

  val timer2 = Timer(1000, startPending = true) // Stays pending until you call start()

  val timer3 = Timer(1, unit = TimeUnit.SECONDS) // Ends after ~1 second
  ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### timer.whileWaiting()

Calls the given callback every Scheduler cycle while the timer is either running *or* pending.

<ParamsList params={[
  {
    name: 'callback',
    type: 'Runnable',
    desc: 'The function to perform while waiting',
    typeLink: TypeLinks.LAMBDA,

  ```java
  Timer timer = new Timer(1000, true); // Timer is created in a pending state

  timer.whileWaiting(() -> {
      System.out.println("Hi!");
  });

  // "Hi!" is being printed every loop

  timer.start();

  // "Hi!" is still being printed every loop

  // 1000ms later...

  // "Hi!" is no longer being printed since the timer has ended
  ```

</Tabs>

### timer.whileRunning()

Calls the given callback every Scheduler cycle while the timer is started and running, *and not pending*.

<ParamsList params={[

    name: 'callback',
    type: 'Runnable',
    desc: 'The function to perform while running',

  // "Hi!" is being printed every loop now

  // 1000ms later...

### timer.onDone()

Calls the given callback when the timer ends.

<ParamsList params={[
  {

    type: 'Runnable',
    desc: 'The function to perform when the timer ends',
    typeLink: TypeLinks.LAMBDA,

  // 1000ms later...

  // "Hi!" is printed *once* when the timer ends
  ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### timer.start()

Resets the start time and takes the timer out of a pending state, effectively (re)starting the timer.

<Tabs groupId="programming-language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

  ```java
  Timer timer = new Timer(1000, true); // Timer is created in a pending state

  timer.start();

  // Timer is now running
  ```
</TabItem>

  ```kotlin
  val timer = Timer(1000, startPending = true) // Timer is created in a pending state

  timer.start()

  // Timer is now running
  ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### timer.setPending()

Sets the timer to a pending state if nothing or `true` is passed, or takes it out of pending if `false` is passed.

<ParamsList params={[
  {
    name: 'pending',
    type: 'boolean',
    desc: 'Whether the timer should be pending or not',
    defaultsTo: 'true',
  }
]}/>

<Tabs groupId="programming-language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

  ```java
  Timer timer = new Timer(1000); // Timer is created started

  timer.setPending();

  // Timer is now pending

  timer.setPending(false);

  // Timer is no longer pending
  ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kt" label="Kotlin">

  ```kotlin
  val timer = Timer(1000) // Timer is created started

  timer.setPending()

  // Timer is now pending

  timer.setPending(false)

  // Timer is no longer pending
  ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### timer.finishPrematurely()

Stops the timer, still fires the `onDone` callback. Does not set the timer to a pending state.

<Tabs groupId="programming-language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

  ```java
  Timer timer = new Timer(1000); // Timer is created started

  timer.onDone(() -> {
      System.out.println("Hi!");
  });

  timer.stop(); // "Hi!" is still printed once

  // Timer is now stopped
  ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kt" label="Kotlin">

  ```kotlin
  val timer = Timer(1000) // Timer is created started

  timer.onDone {
      println("Hi!")
  }

  timer.stop() // "Hi!" is still printed once

  // Timer is now stopped
  ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### timer.isDone()

<Returns returns={{
  type: 'boolean',
  desc: 'Whether or not the timer has ended',
}}/>

literally what else do you need to know about this method

### timer.destroy()

Clears the internal state of the timer, pending it and removing all callbacks. The timer is still usable after this,
but everything needs to be resubscribed and the timer needs to be restarted.

Not entirely sure why you'd want to do this, but it's there if you need it lol.

## after

<Tabs groupId="programming-language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

  The `Timer.after()` method is a static method that creates a new timer and starts it immediately.
  After completion, the timer is automatically destroyed.

  It's great for one-off timers that don't need to be reused, especially for adding delay in callbacks!

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kt" label="Kotlin">

  The `after` class provides a nice DSL syntax for creating timers that are only used once.
  After completion, the timer is automatically destroyed.

</Tabs>

### Construction

<ParamsList params={[
  {
    name: 'time',
    type: 'long',
    desc: 'The duration of the timer in **ANY** unit (see below about Unit specification)',
  },
]}/>

### Unit specification

<Tabs groupId="programming-language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

  The unit of the time parameter is specified by the method you call on the `after` instance.

  For example, if you want to create a timer that lasts for 5 seconds, you would do:

  ```java
  Timer.after(5).seconds(() -> {
      // Do whatever
  });
  ```

  Here's a practical example:

  ```java
  button.onFall(() -> {
    claw.openForDepositing();

    after(400).milliseconds(() -> { // You can do a static import for a more DSL-like syntax
      claw.close();
    });

    after(1).seconds(() -> {
      lift.goToZero();
    });

    after(2).unit(TimeUnit.MONTHS, () -> {
      System.out.print("I'm still here!");
    });
  }
  ```

  );
}

## Practical usage example

We use `Timer.after()` in all of our [Task Chains](../util/task-chains), feel free to take a look
through them:

(They're in Kotlin, but they look similar to the Java version and the concepts carry forwards)
