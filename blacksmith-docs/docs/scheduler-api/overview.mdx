# Overview

:::tip
**You can check out our [codebase](https://github.com/RR-9527/robot-code-v2/) in
TeamCode to see how the Scheduler is used in actual code & how it's used with other parts
of Blacksmith**

The majority code is in Kotlin, but many/most of the concepts remain the same.

Read the docs still though.

## What is the Scheduler API?

It's a small library that streamlines the creation of both your autos and **especially your TeleOps!**

It's provided functionality makes your code easier to create, read, and maintain. üòÆüòÆüòÆü§ØüòÆ

*‚ú® Creating TeleOps (·µÉ‚Åø·µà ·µÉ·µò·µó·µíÀ¢ ·µí·∂†·∂ú) has never been easier! ‚ú®*

## that literally answered nothing.

Let's take a look at some bog-standard TeleOp code:

<Tabs groupId="programming-language">
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

  ```java
  @TeleOp
  public class NotCoolTeleOp extends OpMode {
      @Override
      public void init() {
          // Initialize hardware
      }

      @Override
      public void loop() {
          // Loop code
      }

      // ...300 billion lines later...

      private boolean gamepad2aPreviousState = //...;

      private void checkIfShouldDoSomething() {
         if (gamepad2.a && !gamepad2aPreviousState) { // Messy and ugly and ew ü§Æ
             claw.intake();
         } else if (!gamepad2.a && gamepad2aPreviousState) { // Ugly unreadable signal edge detectors
             claw.close();
         } // Can't tell if the driver does this or the codriver at the quick glance
         gamepad1aPreviousState = //...;
      } // ugh imperative hell
  }
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="kt" label="Kotlin">

  ```kotlin
  @TeleOp
  class `NotCoolTeleOpüòî` : OpMode() {
      override fun init() {
          // Initialize hardware
      }

      override fun loop() {
          // Loop code
      }

      // ...300 billion lines later...

      private var gamepad2aPreviousState = //... (mutable state!!!1!1!1)

      private fun checkIfShouldDoSomething() {
         if (gamepad2.a && !gamepad2aPreviousState) { // Messy and ugly and ew ü§Æ
             claw.intake()
         } else if (!gamepad2.a && gamepad2aPreviousState) { // Ugly unreadable signal edge detectors
             claw.close()
         } // Can't tell if the driver does this or the codriver at the quick glance
         gamepad1aPreviousState = //...
      } // ugh imperative hell
  }
  ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now the same TelpOp after receiving the Scheduler (and [BlackOp](../black-op/overview) treatment:

<Tabs groupId="programming-language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

  ```java
  @TeleOp
  public class CoolTeleOp extends BlackOp {
      @EvalOnGo(method = "getReforgedGamepad2")
      private ReforgedGamepad codriver;

      @Override
      public void go() {
          describeControls(); // Abstracting it to a method for readability

          Scheduler.launchOnStart(this, () -> {
              // Any extra code to run every loop
          });
      }

      private void describeControls() {
          codriver.a.onRise(claw::intake); // Simple and easy to read
          codriver.a.onFall(claw::close); // Complexity is abstracted away
      }
  }
  ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kt" label="Kotlin">

  ```kotlin
  @TeleOp
  class `CoolTeleOpüòé` : BlackOp() {
      private val codriver by createOnGo<ReforgedGamepad> { gamepad2 }

      override fun go() {
          describeControls() // Abstracting it to a method for readability

          Scheduler.launchOnStart(this) {
              // Any extra code to run every loop
          }
      }

      private fun describeControls() {
          codriver.a.onRise(claw::intake) // Simple and easy to read
          codriver.a.onFall(claw::close) // Complexity is abstracted away
      }
  }
  ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

As you can see, it dramatically improves code quality and readability, and makes it easier to
develop and maintain‚Äîafter all, you no longer have to deal with basic boilerplate logic.

üöÄ *Instead of telling the code exactly what to do, you just tell it what you want!*

## Practical examples:

## Confused?

### Uh, what are those weird symbols?

The Scheduler API does require some medium-level knowledge of Java, but it's really not too hard to
learn. You just need to have fairly surface level knowledge of lambdas and how to use an annotation
and such to use this API.

Check out the FAQ page for some learning resources.

(I'm assuming if you're using Kotlin, you're already familiar with such higher level concepts)

### What is BlackOp?

You don't need to use this, you can use LinearOpMode if you'd like, but it's our own extension
to the LinearOpMode which provides some extra functionality for a more seamless developer experience.
Check out [this](../black-op/overview) for more info.

### what is @CreateOnGo/createOnGo?

A very nice part of [BlackOp](../black-op/create-on-go-kt). There's a `@CreateOnGo`
[equivalent](../black-op/create-on-go-java) for Java too!

### Wth is a ReforgedGamepad or `codriver.a.onRise`??

Read on, it's described in the docs in a little bit. Or click [here.](./reforged-gamepad)
