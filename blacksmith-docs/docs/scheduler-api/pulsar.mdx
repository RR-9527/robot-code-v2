# Pulsars

:::warning
A pulsar's resolution is tied to the performance of the Scheduler loop. If there's a heavy
computation involved, the pulsar may not fire at the exact time it was scheduled for.

For example, if you have a pulsar set to go off in 50ms intervals, but the loop is busy for an extra
50ms, the pulsar will fire up to 100ms after it was scheduled.

This is not meant for very precise timing. But then again, without multithreading (which I don't
reallly recommend for most cases), it's not really possible to get a higher resolution timer
anyways. **It's good enough for most use cases.**

## Overview

Pulsars are akin to timers, except they're like timers on a loop, where they 'pulse' every 'x' time
units. You can use one to do something every, say, 100ms.

## Pulsar methods

### Construction

Constructs a new Pulsar with the given interval. Pulsar is automatically started upon creation.

<ParamsList params={[
  {
    name: 'interval',
    type: 'long',
    desc: 'The interval the pulsar should pulse at, in milliseconds',
  },
  {
    name: 'unit',
    type: 'TimeUnit',
    desc: 'The time unit of the timer. Defaults to milliseconds',
    typeLink: TypeLinks.TIME_UNIT,
    defaultsTo: 'TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS',
  }
]}/>

### pulsar.onPulse()

Calls the given callback every Scheduler cycle while the timer is either running *or* pending.

<ParamsList params={[
  {
    name: 'callback',
    type: 'Runnable',
    desc: 'The function to run every x time units',
    typeLink: TypeLinks.LAMBDA,
  }
]}/>

<Returns returns={{
  type: 'Timer',
  desc: 'The Timer itself to allow for method chaining',
  typeLink: TypeLinks.TIMER,
}}/>
