# Custom Schedulables

The Listener (and a couple of other things) implement an interface called Schedulable, which
represents something that can be hooked to the Scheduler to be ran every loop.

:::danger
Your Schedulables will not run unless they're hooked to the Scheduler & the Scheduler is running
:::

The definition of Schedulable is as follows:

<Tabs groupId="programming-language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

  ```java
  public interface Schedulable {
      void tick();
      void destroy();

      default void hook() {
          Scheduler.hook(this);
      }
  }
  ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kt" label="Kotlin">

  ```kotlin
  interface Schedulable {
      fun tick()
      fun destroy()

      fun hook() {
          Scheduler.hook(this)
      }
  }
  ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You'll notice three methods:

## tick()

tick() is the method that's called every loop, and runs after the `beforeEach()` block, and before
the `beforeEach()` block, intermingled with the other Schedulables, such as Listeners.

## destroy()

destroy() is called when someone nukes the Scheduler of all it's Schedulables, and you should
provide any cleanup logic there. Your Schedulable will be automatically unhooked when the Scheduler
is nuked of it's Schedulables.

## hook()

hook() simply hooks your Schedulable to the Scheduler. You should not need to touch this method
unless you're doing some custom logic when hooking it.
