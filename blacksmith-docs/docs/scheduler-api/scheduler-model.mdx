# The Scheduler model

The Scheduler model is quite simply reallyâ€”it's just a fancy loop.

<EmptyLoopDiagram/>

Okay, it's slightly more complicated than that, but that's what it is at it's very core.

<OrderedLoopDiagram/>

Yeahhh okay, that's not as helpful as I thought. Anyway...

## The Scheduler is a glorified loop

The Scheduler model is a loop that runs until the OpMode is stopped, and this loop is made up of a
few different parts.

### ListenersðŸ‘‚

ðŸ‘€ This is the juicy bit, these are the backbone of the Scheduler API. Or wait, are they more like
limbs since they're what actually do things? Whatever, anyways, they run *after* `beforeEach` and
*before* `afterEach` (ðŸ¤¯)

Listeners are objects which hold a condition which hook to and are updated every cycle of the
Scheduler. They can be subscribed to to perform certain actions when certain events are in certain
states.

yeah I know that was a mouthful, so here's a more practical example:

<Tabs groupId="programming-language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

  ```java
  @Override
  public void runOpMode() throws InterruptedException {
      Listener listener = new Listener(() -> gamepad1.a);

      listener.onRise(() -> System.out.println("A was pressed!"));
      listener.onFall(() -> System.out.println("A was released!"));

      listener.whileHigh(() -> System.out.println("A is being held!"));
      listener.whileLow(() -> System.out.println("A is not being touched!"));

      Scheduler.start(this);
  }
  ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kt" label="Kotlin">

  ```kotlin
  override fun runOpMode() {
      val listener = Listener { gamepad1.a }

      listener.onRise { println("A was pressed!") }
      listener.onFall { println("A was released!") }

      listener.whileHigh { println("A is being held!") }
      listener.whileLow { println("A is not being touched!") }

      Scheduler.start(this)
  }
  ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip
Because the above 4 methods return the Listener instance, it can actually
[chain](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2872222/how-to-do-method-chaining-in-java-o-m1-m2-m3-m4)
these methods together, so you can actually do something like this:
```java
listener.onRise(() -> ...)
        .onFall(() -> ...);
```
:::

**Note:** This is a very rough overview of the Listener concept; if you're confused or want more
information, check out the [Listeners](./listeners) page.

We created a Listener which checks if the `a` button was pressed, and then we subscribed to a few
sub-conditions, i.e. `onRise`, `onFall`, `whileHigh`, and `whileLow`.

The `onRise` and `onFall` refer to rising and falling edge states (was *just* pressed and was
*just* released), and the `whileHigh` and `whileLow` refer to the high and low states (is being held
and is not being touched).

Again, the Listener is being updated every loop of the Scheduler, and is functionally equivalent to:

<Tabs groupId="programming-language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

  ```java title="(Using normal OpMode)"
  private boolean gamepad1AWasJustPressed = false;

  @Override
  public void loop {
      if (gamepad1.a && !gamepad1AWasJustPressed) { // onRise
          System.out.println("A was pressed!");
          gamepad1AWasJustPressed = true;
      } else if (!gamepad1.a && gamepad1AWasJustPressed) { // onFall
          System.out.println("A was released!");
          gamepad1AWasJustPressed = false;
      }

      if (gamepad1.a) { // whileHigh
          System.out.println("A is being held!");
      } else { // whileLow
          System.out.println("A is not being touched!");
      }
  }
  ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kt" label="Kotlin">

  ```kotlin title="(Using normal OpMode)"
  private var gamepad1AWasJustPressed = false

  override fun loop() {
      if (gamepad1.a && !gamepad1AWasJustPressed) { // onRise
          println("A was pressed!")
          gamepad1AWasJustPressed = true
      } else if (!gamepad1.a && gamepad1AWasJustPressed) { // onFall
          println("A was released!")
          gamepad1AWasJustPressed = false
      }

      if (gamepad1.a) { // whileHigh
          println("A is being held!")
      } else { // whileLow
          println("A is not being touched!")
      }
  }
  ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

(And this gets even cleaner with the [Reforged Gamepad](./reforged-gamepad)!

### beforeEach

This is a block of code which runs at the very start of every loop.

I myself just use it to reset variables that need to be reset every loop, but you can use it for
whatever you want I guess lol.

You can find an example of how to use this right [here](./scheduler#schedulerbeforeeach).

### afterEach

This is `beforeEach`'s evil twin. It runs at the very end of every loop. It's very useful for
actions that you want to run every loop, like PIDs, driving, or telemetry.

Example [here](./scheduler#schedulerlaunch-).
