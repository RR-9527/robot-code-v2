# Overview

## Overview

The Blacksmith Library is a collection of tools and such for FTC, which focuses on both readability, *and* brevity,
aiming to be as intuitive as possible. It allows you to program more declaratively and worry less about common logic
that serve only to distract you and add more potential points of failure.

**Blacksmith & docs by toptobes (Sin#9527)**

**Kalman filter wizardry by T-Lind (TXKL#1554)**

:::info
All code documentation provide both Java and Kotlin examples

## Enough with the buzzwords, what does it do?

The Blacksmith Library provides a few different things:
 - [The Scheduler API](/scheduler-api/overview) - An API to drastically simplify the creation and
  maintainability of your OpModes, and make them much cleaner and terser. It provides many methods
  to hide away a lot of extra logic that you don't need to worry about, such as scheduling when to
  run certain code.
 - [Anvil](/anvil/overview) - A wrapper around [Roadrunner's](https://learnroadrunner.com/)
  [TrajectorySequenceBuilder](https://learnroadrunner.com/trajectory-sequence.html) which provides
  a much nicer API for creating trajectories, as well as implicit unit conversion and utilities for
  creating trajectories on the fly without slowing down your auto.
 - [BlackOp](/black-op/overview) - An extension to the traditional OpMode/LinearOpMode which
  contains some extra features for a more seamless and carefree development experience
 - [Kalman Filters](./util/kalmanfilters/kalmanfilter-object) - Helps improve encoder (by
  potentially a lot) reading by dampening noise. Helped improve our own auto's localization a lot,
  and solved a lot of our lift issues.
 - And quite a decent amount of [utilities...](/util/overview)

I recommend checking those out for examples of each.

**If you use Kotlin (or even if you don't honestly), I highly recommend checking out our codebase in TeamCode to see how
Blacksmith is used in actual code**

Here's a basic example of a TeleOp before and after using Blacksmith:

<Tabs groupId="programming-language">
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

  ```java
  @TeleOp
  public class NotCoolTeleOp extends OpMode {
      @Override
      public void init() {
          // Initialize hardware
      }

      @Override
      public void loop() {
          // Loop code
      }

      // ...300 billion lines later...

      private boolean gamepad2aPreviousState = //...;

      private void checkIfShouldDoSomething() {
         if (gamepad2.a && !gamepad2aPreviousState) { // Messy and ugly and ew ðŸ¤®
             claw.intake();
         } else if (!gamepad2.a && gamepad2aPreviousState) { // Ugly unreadable signal edge detectors
             claw.close();
         } // Can't tell if the driver does this or the codriver at the quick glance
         gamepad1aPreviousState = //...;
      } // ugh imperative hell
  }
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="kt" label="Kotlin">

  ```kotlin
  @TeleOp
  class `NotCoolTeleOpðŸ˜”` : OpMode() {
      override fun init() {
          // Initialize hardware
      }

      override fun loop() {
          // Loop code
      }

      // ...300 billion lines later...

      private var gamepad2aPreviousState = //... (mutable state!!!1!1!1)

      private fun checkIfShouldDoSomething() {
         if (gamepad2.a && !gamepad2aPreviousState) { // Messy and ugly and ew ðŸ¤®
             claw.intake()
         } else if (!gamepad2.a && gamepad2aPreviousState) { // Ugly unreadable signal edge detectors
             claw.close()
         } // Can't tell if the driver does this or the codriver at the quick glance
         gamepad1aPreviousState = //...
      } // ugh imperative hell

As you can see, the Blacksmith version is much different, but it's much more readable and easier to make changes to.
It's easy to learn and only requires medium-level knowledge of Java.

## I don't understand these symbols

The guide does require some knowledge of Java, but it's not very hard to learn. If you're not familiar with Java, I recommend
checking out the FAQ page for some resources to learn what you need to know for this framework.

If you're using Kotlin, this guide does somewhat presume you know what you're doing and won't explain the Kotlin as much.

## I don't understand all these words

They're probably described in the docs somewhere, just keep reading.

## Okay... but what about performance?

The performance impact is negligible; CPUs are fast, and you have other things to worry about in terms of performance.

This API is simply a couple layers of abstraction on top of the existing FTC SDK, and is in no way computationally
expensive.

Plus... the majority of the overhead is just at initialization time and clears up fairly quickly
