# Overview

:::info
Anvil assumes that you are at least somewhat familiar with Roadrunner's [TrajectorySequenceBuilders](https://learnroadrunner.com/trajectory-sequence.html).
The Anvil docs will only cover in detail special methods that the normal TrajectorySequenceBuilder API does not have.
To learn more about TrajectorySequences & Roadrunner in general, check out [learnroadrunner.com](https://learnroadrunner.com)

## What is Anvil?

Anvil is a wrapper around Roadrunner `v0.5.x`'s [TrajectorySequenceBuilder](https://learnroadrunner.com/trajectory-sequence.html)
that provides a *much* nicer API, providing utilities to heavily speed up both your auto and your development time!

:::warning Warning
**Anvil does not yet support `v1.0.0+`** as it is not yet truly battle tested, and for that reason, I do not yet trust it.
:::

## Features

 - Intuitive and cleaner methods for building and running TrajectorySequences

 - Implicit unit conversion- program your auto in any units you want by changing just a couple lines!

 - Trajectory generation is implicitly done in background threads unless otherwise specified
   - Trajectories normally take a while to create on the fly, so it slows down your auto when done in the main thread
   - Using background threads (or rather coroutines) prevents your auto from being bogged down when generating however
     many trajectories you'd like!

 - Works together with other parts of Blacksmith for even more conciseness and practicality

## Example

<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

  ```java title="BaseAuto.java"
  abstract class BaseAuto extends BlackOp {
      @CreateOnGo // Using BlackOp's CreateOnGo for cleaner object creation
      protected AutoBotComponents bot;

      @CreateOnGo(passHwMap = true)
      protected SampleMecanumDrive drive;

      protected Pose2d startPose;
      protected abstract Anvil mainTraj(Pose2d startPose);

      @Override
      public void go() {
          Anvil startTraj = mainTraj(startPose);

          Anvil
              .startAutoWith(startTraj)
              .onSchedulerLaunch();

          Scheduler.launchOnStart(this, () -> {
              drive.update();
              bot.update();
          });
      }
  }
  ```

  ```java title="AutoDemo.java"
  @Autonomous
  class AutoDemo extends BaseAuto {
      public AutoDemo() {
          // We can use GlobalUnits.pos() to create a Pose2d of our own desired units that
          // automatically converts to inches/radians for us
          startPose = GlobalUnits.pos(x, y, r);
      }

      @Override
      protected Anvil mainTraj(Pose2d startPose) {
          return Anvil.forgeTrajectory(drive, startPose)
              .forward(10)
              .addTemporalMarker(100, () -> {
                  /* Do something */
              })
              .back(10)
              .thenRun(this::parkTraj);
      }

      private Anvil parkTraj(Pose2d startPose) {
          /* Create and return parking trajectory */
      }
  }

## Confused?

### Why are there two different auto files?

That's just how I like to organize my auto files- one BaseAuto class for all the common logic
that all of the autos use, and separate files for each unique auto for their own paths.

You are, however, welcome to use Anvil with all your logic and stuff in a single class or however
else you like and feel comfortabe with.

### What is BlackOp or @CreateOnGo?

You don't need to use this, you can use LinearOpMode if you'd like, or even OpMode if you want to
build and run the trajectories yourself (read for manual building/running)
Check out [this](../black-op/overview) for more info

### What are GlobalUnits?

You don't need to use this.
Check out [this](../util/global-units) for more info

### Can I use this to just build a trajectory?

TODO()


### What does '::' mean?

TODO()

### What is AutoBotComponents?

It's just a class I made that keeps all of the motors and servos and stuff together in one class
to keep it organized. You can do whatever you'd like, I just did this to make my code look cleaner.

### What do all of those Anvil methods do?

Read the rest of the Anvil docs to find out.
