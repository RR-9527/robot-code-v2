# Usage without SampleMecanumDrive

If you still want to use Anvil without SampleMecanumDrive (or MeepMeep's DriveShim), you can just
define your own class that implements `DriveProxy`, which is an interface that contains all of
the methods Anvil may call from the normal SampleMecanumDrive.

Again, keep in mind you can pass in the MeepMeep DriveShim directly if you want, though I'm not 100%
sure of all of the normal methods work on it- at least the ones I use do.

```java
// Example using RR Quickstart's SampleTankDrive

class MyTankDrive implements DriveProxy {
    SampleTankDrive myTankDrive = //...;

    public void followTrajectorySequenceAsync(Object seq) {
        // Notice the necessary casting
        myTankDrive.followTrajectorySequenceAsync((TrajectorySequence) seq);
    }

    // other necessary methods...

    public TrajectoryVelocityConstraint getVelocityConstraint(...) {
        return SampleTankDrive.getVelocityConstraint(...);
    }
}
```
