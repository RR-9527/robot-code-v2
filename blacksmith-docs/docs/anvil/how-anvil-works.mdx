# How Anvil works

:::info
You don't need to read this, it's just if anyone's curious roughly how anvil works behind the scenes
and why it works the way it does. It could help you understand Anvil's quirks and abilities better
though.
:::

## Reflection

```kotlin
// Anvil uses a lot of reflection behind the scenes to interact with the
// SampleMecanumDrive and the TrajectorySequenceBuilder, since they're
// copy-pasted into the client's own codebase rather than a concrete API
// that can easily be worked with.

// Because of this, Anvil can be finicky at times, and less type safe than
// one would hope. But at the same it, it arguably makes Anvil even more
// powerful as well, allowing it to work with any class that simply defines
// the required methods- for example, it worked perfect fine with MeepMeep with
// absolutely no modification. But anyways, I digress
```

## Stack-oriented

```kotlin
// When you do something like 'anvil.forwards(10)', you might expect that
// to immediately apply .forwards(10.toInches) to the underlying
// TrajectorySequenceBuilder

// But yeah no, what actually happens is that Anvil defines a stack that
// holds all of the desired actions, and only applies the actions when
// the stack is flushed.

// So when you do the following...

anvil
    .forwards(10)
    .inReverse {
        splineTo(20, 20, 180)
    }

// ...this is what it would look like (if the stack was a visual thing):

/* Top of stack */
3. setReversed(false)
2. splineTo(20.toInches(), 20.toInches(), 180.toRadians())
1. setReversed(true)
0. forwards(10.toInches())
/* Bottom of stack */

// Now I know I said it's a stack, but it's actually a deque (a double-ended queue)
// and when a method like .build() or something else which flushes the deque is
// called, the deque is flushed as if it were a normal queue, applying the
// operators in sequential order onto the TrajectorySequenceBuilder

// This form of architecture allows for a more powerful method of manipulating
// TrajectorySequenceBuilders, since it allows you to easily undo an operation,
// or modify an existing one.

// For example, if I do 'anvil.forwards(10)', this is what the stack would be like:

1. forwards(10.toInches())
0. whatever
/* Bottom of stack */

// Now, I could call a method like .doInReverse(), which would pop the stack:

--> forwards(10.toInches())

0. whatever
/* Bottom of stack */

// then take that action and surround it by a couple of calls
// to trajseqbuilder.setReversed(true/false)

3. setReversed(false)
2. forwards(10.toInches())
1. setReversed(true)
0. whatever
/* Bottom of stack */

// Again, this is just an example, but, to summarize, it allows for things like
anvil.whatever().forwards(10).doInReverse()

// Now, in the Java world, it's not *as* useful, but it's quite nice for Kotlin where
// most things are expressions and not statements, and you may want to do something
// like so

when {
    n == 0 -> splineTo(a, b, c)
    n == 1 -> splineTo(i, j, k)
    else   -> splineTo(x, y, z)
}.doInReverse()

// If we used inReverse{} here, it'd create another layer of nesting which just
// isn't as clean

// All in all, I'm not using the stack manipulation a ton right now, but it sets
// up the framework for future modifications to make Anvil even more powerful. It
// also helps w/ the background trajectory generation

// that being said I probably won't use it a ton since it can be a bit finicky for
// people who doesn't really know how Anvil works
```

## Background Trajectory generation

```kotlin
// As you may know, Anvil implicitly generates your trajectories in a
// background thread unless explicitly told otherwise via the Anvil config
// object.

// To do this, it just uses coroutines to start building the trajectory as soon
// as the trajectory building it starts to run via a temporal marker

private val builderScope = CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Default + SupervisorJob())

// Then, when it's finally time for the building trajectory to be run, Anvil
// just waits for it to finish building then runs it. Ideally, the trajectory
// has already finished building, but if it's not, the running trajectory may
// stall for a tiny bit.

/* A simplified version of the thenRun method */
fun thenRun(nextTrajectory: (Pose2d) -> Anvil) {
    flushDeque()

    // Generates a new key for every trajectory so that multiple
    // trajectories can be generated at the same time and retrieved
    // later
    val key = Object()

    builderDeque.addFirst {
        // Can't use '_addTemporalMarker' as that adds to the end of the deque
        builderProxy.UNSTABLE_addTemporalMarkerOffset(0.0) {
            val nextStartPose = getCurrentEndPose()

            // Starts building it
            preforgedTrajectories[key] = builderScope.async {
                nextTrajectory( nextStartPose ).build()
            }
        }
    }

    // _addTemporalMarker() is an internal Anvil method to add a temporal marker
    // to the deque
    _addTemporalMarker(0) {
        // Waits for trajectory to finish building
        // (Should already be done)
        val nextTrajectoryBuilt = runBlocking { preforgedTrajectories[key]?.await() }!!

        run( nextTrajectoryBuilt )
    }
}
```
