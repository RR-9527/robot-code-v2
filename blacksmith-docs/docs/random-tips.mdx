# A couple random tips

One thing I see a lot in FTC programming is that a lot of people don't take the time to really
learn programming- rather they just learn the FTC SDK, and don't go much deeper.

Here are just a couple very random tips that should make Blacksmith easier to learn/use.

1. One of the most important parts of being a programmer is learning to problem solve. Using resources,
debugging techniques such as logging, etc. is a very important skill, and one can't rely on just asking
questions hoping to get their problem solved for them.

2. To go to the source code of a class or where a variable was defined or something, hover over a class
name or method or variable name or something in the code, and `Ctrl + Click` on it to go to explore
how roughly it works and see extra documentation. *Looking through the library code for both
Blacksmith and everything else can really help you understand what's actually happening under
the hood*

3. Press `Ctrl+Alt+L` to auto-format your code a bit nicer if you can't be bothered to do it yourself.

4. Sacrifice your first-born child to the programming gods.

5. Take a little bit of time to actually learn Java and Android Studio so that you aren't just bumbling
around, hoping to chance upon the right solution. This seems a bit obvious, but not enough people
actually do this.
