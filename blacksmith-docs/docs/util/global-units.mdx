# GlobalUnits

## Overview

The `GlobalUnits` are the base distange, angle, and time units used by the framework when not explicitly specified.

These default to:
- `distance -> DistanceUnit.INCHES`
- `angle -> AngleUnit.RADIANS`
- `time -> TimeUnit.SECONDS`

You can however set them manually in two ways:

:::tip
I **highly** recommend using the second method, even though it takes a couple extra steps. The first method has some
**dangers** covered if you scroll down a little.
:::

:::note
Also you *can* reset the variables multiple times and even combine both methods if you'd like.
:::

## Setting up

### Method 1

Calling the `GlobalUnits.setUnits()` method in your code:

<Tabs groupId="programming-language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

  ```java
  public class MyTeleOp extends BlackOp {
      @Override
      public void go() {
          // Set just the distanceUnit
          GlobalUnits.setUnits(DistanceUnit.SMOOTS);

          // Set distanceUnit and angleUnit
          GlobalUnits.setUnits(DistanceUnit.SMOOTS, AngleUnit.ARCSECONDS)

          // Set all three units
          GlobalUnits.setUnits(DistanceUnit.SMOOTS, AngleUnit.ARCSECONDS, TimeUnit.CENTURIES)
      }
  }
  ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kt" label="Kotlin">

  ```kotlin
  class MyTeleOp : BlackOp() {
      override fun go() {
          // Set just the distanceUnit
          GlobalUnits.setUnits(DistanceUnit.SMOOTS)

          // Set distanceUnit and angleUnit
          GlobalUnits.setUnits(DistanceUnit.SMOOTS, AngleUnit.ARCSECONDS)

          // Set all three units
          GlobalUnits.setUnits(DistanceUnit.SMOOTS, AngleUnit.ARCSECONDS, TimeUnit.CENTURIES)
      }
  }
  ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::danger
There is a downside/risk to this method. Look at this code:
```java
pubic class MyTeleOp extends BlackOp {
    // This is created BEFORE the right units are set
    // So this startPose was created using inches and radians
    // Not centimetes and degrees, as was desired
    Pose2d startPose = new Pose2d(toIn(50), toIn(50), toRad(180));

    @Override
    public void go() {
        // This is called too late
        GlobalUnits.setUnits(DistanceUnit.CENTIMETERS, AngleUnit.DEGREES);
    }
}
```
Basically, calling any method that uses the units before the units are properly set
will lead to some undesired behaviour.
:::

### Method 2

In the second method, we're doing to use a **config file** to set the units, which solves the aforementioned problem.

First, find the `Teamcode -> src -> main -> res -> raw` folder

In the `raw` folder, create a new file called `bsm_units.properties` file

:::caution Important
Spelling and case-sensitivity is **very** important here.
:::

![](/img/randomassets/global_units2.png)

Finally, in the `units.properties` file, put in the following:

```sass
distance=insert_unit_here
angle=insert_unit_here
time=insert_unit_here
```

:::danger Very important
Unit spelling must also be ON POINT.

To get the spellings for each supported unit, find the doc for the designed unit (e.g. [`DistanceUnit`](../etc/units/distance)),
and copy paste over whichever unit you want (e.g. `centimeters` or `LIGHT_YEARS`)

*Unit names are not case sensitive
