# Offline usage

Blacksmith's documentation site is a Progressive Web App, and there's two ways to use it offline:

## Method 1:

open the documentation site with your wifi on, wait for like 30 seconds or so, then turn your wifi
off/connect to your bot's wifi, and then you'll notice the whole site works perfectly fine
both online and offline, as long as you don't exit the site. Refreshing is fine.

If this doesn't work, use method two.

:::tip
If you try to open a new doc tab, you'll notice it'll require an internet connection even if the
original tab works perfectly well offline.

A workaround is to control-click on a link in the original tab to open up the site in a new tab, and
that'll work perfectly fine offline as well

## Method 2:

If the above doesn't work, you can always install it as an app, and it *should* continue to work
offline no matter what, but I hold no guarantee.

Now, the method of installation can differ between devices/browsers so I'll let you look up how to
install it yourself, but I promise to you it shouldn't take more than 1 or 2 clicks.
