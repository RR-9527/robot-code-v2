# Offline usage

Blacksmith's documentation site is a Progressive Web App, and there's two ways to use it offline:

## Method 1:

open the documentation site with your wifi on, wait for like 30 seconds or so, then turn your wifi
off/connect to your bot's wifi, and then you'll notice the whole site works perfectly fine
both online and offline, as long as you don't exit the site. Refreshing is fine.
